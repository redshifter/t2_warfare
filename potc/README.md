# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

# GAMETYPE FEATURES
## Flyin' a havoc o'er th' high seas
Yer goal be t' put together a havoc crew 'n commandeer th' high seas. Take all challengers, 'n make them walk th' plank!

(Thar ain't actually any mission code. Or objectives. This gametype be too high-brow fer that.)

## Banned Weapons
Don't ye DARE be caught wit' these weapons, or I'll make ye walk th' plank meself, ya scurvy cur!
- Chaingun (default loadout has a lance instead)
- Missile Launcher
- Sensor Jammer
- Ammo Pack (but I don't remember why)
- Mines

## Havoc Changes
- Ye crew can summon 8 havocs at once. 'cause that many scallywags are really goin' t' play this.
- Ye boosters loot up less o' th' shield, t' make yer battle on th' high seas most interestin'.
- Shocklances will not throw ye Havoc off if ye are in a Havoc that belongs t' yer crew.

## Other Features
- Ye can carry far more than yer pantaloons would normally carry.
- Ye can not destroy any o' th' base equipment, so don't even try.
