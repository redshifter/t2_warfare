# My Tribes 2 Gametypes/Mods

## Team Gametypes

##### [Warfare](warfare)
This is basically two-sided Siege. Explode the gens to drop the forcefields and touch the enemy switch! But don't let your opponent do the same! Best of 5 rounds. Not many maps were made.

##### Capture and Hold modification
Spawn with Energy, a few other QoL improvements, and a new team scoring system that aims for much shorter games (around 15 minutes for a balanced game, less than 5 minutes for a pub-stomp).

##### Pirates of the Caribbean
A gametype where you grab a Havoc and sail the scurvy seas, matey! There is no win condition, so just do whatever you feel is right.

##### Team Deatchmatch
Deathmatch with teams. Mostly ran its course, allowing people on pond to pretend to play Arena without drawing actual Arena players into their game.

##### Team Rabbit 2 v4.31
The latest version that I know to exist. Mostly redundant by the existence of Jetball.

## Single Player Gametypes

##### [Blaster Deathmatch](blasterdm)
Deathmatch involving only the blaster. This was fleshed out into a full gametype unlike the other DM variants on this list. Most of the maps are indoors, making it more <s>fun</s> spammy.

##### Shrike Deathmatch
A gametype I made when I had morbid curiosity. You accelerate really fast into the field of battle.

##### Chaingun Deathmatch
Deathmatch only involving the chaingun. I mostly made this as a joke.

##### Single-Weapon Deathmatch
Not sure if I actually completed this work, but if I did it would supercede Chaingun Deathmatch.

##### Go Fish
A crappy indoor rabbit gametype, meant for learning complicated interiors like the Ultima Thule base. For some reason I thought it would be good design if people could hurt each other while nobody was carrying the flag. Was never actually played and definitely needs some tweaks. Single player mode is a crappy time trial.

##### NotRabbit
A gametype about skiing through flags. It's pretty garbage and there's probably a better gametype that could be made around the concept of going fast.

##### Golf
A gametype about precision mortaring. (WARNING: This gametype carries a terrible curse that destroys computers.)

## Server Mods that I don't know why I made

##### [UltraRS](_mods/UltraRS)
Most ultra mods are based on instagib and near-hitscan weapons. I decided that was stupid. I just made all the guns fire super fast. This was still pretty stupid.

##### [Overdrive](_mods/Overdrive)
Basically UltraRS except based on classic physics. Also getting an Energy Pack and press the pack button turns your already super gun into an even superer overdrive gun for a few seconds. This didn't really fix how stupid it was, but the weapons are pretty hilarious. I was especially proud of the Chaingun Mortar.

##### [Hyperdrive]](_mods/HyperDrive)
A fork of UltraRS where you only have a fast firing disc and grenade launcher, which have very limited ammo that refill after a few seconds, meaning players can't spam. Also has a super fast walk speed and a few other surprises.
