Red Shifter's License for Tribes 2 Works v1.1

Copyright (c) 2021 "Red Shifter"

The goal of this license is to
- Forbid commerical use
- Forbid the soliciation of donations except by people of high moral standing
- Preserve derivative works and keep server admins from holding onto them
- Indemnify the creators of works, taking away all implications of liability and warranty

PERSONAL USE
Blanket permission is granted to keep a copy of the work and use it for your own personal use. Personal use is defined as any use on a game server with
a maximum of 4 human players on it.

COMMERICAL USE
Commerical use is explicitly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to running a server for money, pay-to-play servers, etc. An exception to
this rule is made for servers that solicit donations to continue running, as long as such servers are publicly available for play by a reasonable
player (one that does not get themselves banned by reducing the ability to play by others on their team, cheating, spouting racial epithets, spreading
Russian right-wing propaganda, illegal activites, etc).

Donations may not be solicited to run a server that runs this work or its derivatives, except by server providers of high moral standing, both in
general and as defined in this license. Running a public Discord server tangential to a game server, or any other related activity, is not considered
the soliciation of donations, as long as boosting/donating to the server does not give a person additional access to any aspect of the server.

Admin rights may be given to trusted high donors, but any unexpected features of the admin toolset (such as being able to lightning strike someone
or drive around in a shrike on team 3) must be plainly obvious upon invocation, such as through a chat message that has the proper sound attached
when said power is invoked, or through its use making it blatantly obvious.

Server/game access may not be given only to donors. However, a priority queue may be used on a server and access to it may be given to donors, as
long as it does not comprise more than 12.5% of the available slots on said server (ex. 4 slots of a 32 player server).

No other special access to a server may be given in exchange for a donation.

DERIVATIVE WORKS
In this license, a "derivative work" is any map, any code modification, any code addition with the explicit purpose of changing how the code works, etc.

All derivative works are fine as long as such modifications are PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. It is EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED to run any derivative work on a server
without making it publicly available, such as through a website or FTP. Works in progress, test versions, etc. do not need to be uploaded for public
availability immediately. However, if said versions are requested and are still in active use on a server, it should be made available as soon as
convenient, such as within 24 hours of the request, and such files could be made available informally through Discord, etc.

You may not solicit donations to create a derivative work except within the confines of the COMMERICAL USE clause. All derivative work created through
solicited donations must be publicly available as written in this license.

Derivative works are implied to use this license, even if the license is not included with it. Derivative works that fully replace the existing code
(such as a new version of the work not requiring the existing VL2) MUST include this license. Additional terms may be attached to the license, as long
as this license is unmodified and does not conflict with the terms of this license.

Derivative works based on this work cannot use licenses that are more inclusive, such as MIT License, etc.

HIGH MORAL STANDING
To have a high moral standing as specified in this license, such individuals must not believe in, condone, or tolerate Russian right-wing cult theories
and icons, such as psuedoscience, Nazism, racism, facism, terrorism, the rigging of the 2020 US election, etc.

They must not hold cryptocurrency that is based on proof-of-work (Bitcoin, Etherium), nor may they hold cryptocurrency where they don't know if it's
based on proof-of-work.

They must not cheat or distribute cheats for online games (no exceptions) or in offline games (exception: cheats for an offline game must be plainly
obvious through some on-screen text, or through interactions that make it blatantly obvious that offline game cheating is happening).

They must not work for Epic Games, nor may they work for a company that has uploaded a work to Epic Game Store or any other online storefront run by
Epic Games without also releasing said work to either Steam or a non-DRM PC storefront first. They must not condone any other company that expects a
work week of 70 hours or more.

"High moral standing" is not limited by the explicit terms of this license.

As written in other sections, if you lack a high moral standing, you may not solicit donations for any aspect of running a server with this code on
that server, or to create a d erivative work (though you may still create a derivative work as laid out in its section; you are just not allowed to
solicit donations for such an activity).

INDEMNIFICATION

TRICKERY CLAUSE
This is not an ironclad contract. I am not a lawyer. This license will be interpreted how I see fit. Malicious attempts to get around loopholes in
the license are considered a violatios of the license, and you immediately forfeit all rights to the work and its derivatives.
