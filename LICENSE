RED SHIFTER'S TRIBES 2 WORK LICENSE (C) 2021

NOTE: This licensing agreement does not contain a binding arbitration agreement, but is written by an asshole.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- This license limits liability and warranty in the same way as MIT License.
- This license excludes modification and creation derivative works without permission of the author, except in the
  case of bug fixes (and not functionality additions). Maps are not considered derivative works.
- Any incompatibility with TacoMod is considered a feature and not a bug, and therefore cannot be fixed.
- This license prevents all commercial use.
- This license excludes distribution.
- This license includes a moral character standing test.
- If something in this license is unenforceable by a court of law, all other clauses survive, and you have also failed
  the moral character standing test.

LICENSE TEXT
Most licenses are about being a serious ironclad contract written in legalese for laywers to read and make lots
of money. This license is about trying to make it funny and probably be vaguely confusing in the meantime. All
parts of the agreement will be interpreted however I see fit.

The content contained within is provided as-is, and so is all the code in it. You will not use it, host it,
decompile it, etc, except as laid out in this license.

You agree to indemnify (hold not accountable) me for all reasons, regardless of whether I knew this thing would
blow up your computer.

This license grants you an agreement to use and analyze the code of the work in an unmodified form as you see fit,
as long as it is not being used to solicit or request money, services, status, etc.

Acceptance of the agreement does not extend to the players in a server of a game.

You may not modify the code or work, or invoke it in such a way that it becomes a derivative work, except to fix bugs
in the original work. No improvements may be made. EXCEPTION: Any work being incompatible with TacoMod is considered
a feature and not a bug, and therefore does not constitute a bug fix.

This license explicitly excludes the ability to make modifications or derivative works based on the work, except with
my explicit permission, or if I have abandoned all public Tribes and Tribes-adjacent communities for 5 years.

Maps are not considered a derivative work, but the supporting gametype code is, therefore maps can be created and run
by those who have accepted this agreement.

In all cases, derivative works must give proper attribution to anyone who contributed to the work, and must not
contain any of the following:
- Anything illegal
- Glorification of right-wing cult propaganda (including, but not limited to: Nazi imagery, racism, calls to violence,
  etc.)
- Cryptocurrency miners or other malware
- Cheats

Deriviative works must be presented with this license in an unmodified form, and all terms of this license will
supercede any terms in future licenses.

The works laid out here-in may not be distributed on any other site, except in the terms laid out by derivative works.

This agreement is invalid if you believe in right-wing Russian propaganda such as psuedoscience, anti-masking theory,
the 2020 United States election being rigged, Q-anon, Nazi imagery, racism, terrorism, etc. Due to this clause, these
works are absolutely not to be used on Discord Pub.

This agreement is invalid if you work for Epic Games or any organization that has released a game on Epic Game Store
or any other service provided by Epic Games, unless such game was released first or within 24 hours on either Steam
or any service that does not use DRM. This does not include releasing a game on console.

This agreement is invalid if you own cryptocurrency that uses a proof-of-work model (Bitcoin, Etherium, etc), or you
own cryptocurrency and are unsure what a proof-of-work model is and/or whether the cryptocurrency you own uses it.

This agreement is invalid if something is found to be unenforceable by a court of law, I really don't know how we got
to this point, and by virtue of being a gigantic asshole you should not be allowed to interact with this work at all.
Also all other clauses survive such thing.
