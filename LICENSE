Red Shifter's License for Tribes 2 Works v1.4, updated 2021-03-07

Copyright (c) 2021 "Red Shifter"

1. SUMMARY
The goal of this license is to
- Forbid commercial use of this work and its derivatives
- Forbid the solicitation of donations, except with permission
- Preserve derivative works and keep server admins from holding onto them
- Indemnify the creators of works, taking away all implications of liability and warranty

2. PERSONAL USE
Blanket permission is granted to keep a copy of the work and use it for your own personal use. Personal use is defined as any use on a game server with
a maximum of 4 human players on it.

Acceptance of this license is not required in order to play on a server using the work. Only to host the work on your own server.

3. COMMERCIAL USE
Commercial use is explicitly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to running a server for money, pay-to-play servers, etc. There are three
exceptions to this rule:

- Server owners may solicit donations to continue running, as long as permission is received by the author of the work (and in cases of derivative
works, the creators of those works as well). Such permission can be revoked at any time by the author(s).
- Servers that run over a LAN, such as for a LAN party, may host this code as long as all hosted works and derivatives are publicly available. Such
servers cannot accept outside connections (such as from VPN, dark web, etc.)
- Server infrastructure providers (such as Branzone) are not part of commercial use, as long as it's the server operator (such as the person who paid
for said server) is the one who made the decision to include the work on the server.

4. DERIVATIVE WORKS
In this license, a "derivative work" is any map, any code modification, any code addition with the explicit purpose of changing how the code works, etc.

All derivative works are fine as long as such modifications are PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. It is EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED to run any derivative work on a server
without making it publicly available, such as through website, FTP, public GitHub, etc. Works in progress, test versions, etc. do not need to be
uploaded for public availability immediately. However, if said versions are requested and are still in active use on a server, it should be made
available as soon as convenient, such as within 24 hours of the request, and such files could be made available informally through Discord, etc.

Derivative works are implied to use this license, even if the license is not included with it. Derivative works that fully replace the existing code
(such as a new version of the work not requiring the existing VL2) MUST include this license. Additional terms may be attached to the license, as long
as this license is unmodified and does not conflict with the terms of this license. In all cases, this license will be considered to take priority.

Derivative works based on this work cannot use licenses that are more inclusive, such as MIT License, etc.

You may not solicit donations, commissions, etc to create a derivative work based on something using this license.

Derivative works must not contain morally reprehensible or illegal content.

5. INDEMNIFICATION
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS
IN THE SOFTWARE.

6. TRICKERY CLAUSE
This is not an ironclad contract. I am not a lawyer. This license will be interpreted how I see fit. Malicious attempts to get around loopholes in
the license are considered a violatios of the license, and you immediately forfeit all rights to the work and its derivatives.
