# Tribes 2: SkiFree
Free to ski. This is a beta.

Your goal is to ski through a bunch of gates, in order. The terrain, the gates, the spawn platform - everything is random. It's up to you to go for it. But you only have 60 second. Take discjumps and ski the terrain properly, turning where you can. Compete for the best run of the server!

This gametype is the official\* gametype of the 20th Anniversary of Tribes 2.

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
- Simply drop the [SkiFreeGameType.vl2](SkiFreeGameType.vl2) file into the base folder of your Tribes 2 install, like a map pack.
- If you use an admin mod to customize the map rotation, make sure to add SkiFree (SkiFree) to the rotation.
