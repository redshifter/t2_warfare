GAME FEATURES
-------------------------
- BLASTER OWNAGE
Ownage by blaster is the name of the game.  In the frantic arena, players must act calmly
under extreme circumstances, or, more likely, pray and spray.

- SCORING
You gain points by hitting or killing your opponents.  Throw away your energy pack, and you
can gain even more points.

Every hit will be awarded with 3 points.  If not wearing an energy pack, you gain 4 points.
Every kill will be awarded with 2 points.  If not wearing an energy pack, you gain 5 points.
A clean kill while wearing an energy pack will give you 14 to 17 points.
A clean kill while NOT wearing energy pack will give you 21 to 25 points.

That's not the whole story.  You can lose points as well.

Every time you hit yourself, you will lose a point.
Every time you die, by your own hand or not, you will lose a point.

- SELF-HEALING through the powers of Vampirism
You may notice a lack of stations, and a lack of pickups.  Fear not, for you can still gain
healing through the powers of Vampirism!  Every time you make a kill, you gain back about
30% of your health.  This will protect you from a single blaster shot.  If you are already
at full health, you will gain a Repair Kit.

- ACCURACY, or the lack thereof
How bad is your aim?  Your accuracy is measured during the game.  Go to the score screen and
see if your aim is really as bad as you think it is.

- FLARES
Throw a few flares around.  VGW VGW VGW!

Every time you get hit, you will spontaneously throw a flare.  This flare doesn't come from
your inventory, so get hit as often as you can!  Or not...

KNOW YOUR TERRAIN
-------------------------
ALCATRAZ - Map by Dynamix Staff.  Adaptation by Red Shifter.
A fortified island base has become the site of a dangerous free-for-all.  This map combines
outdoor and indoor areas into a chaotic battlefield.  This darker, more menacing version of
Alcatraz was specifically designed for Deathmatch.  Stay away from the lethal water, or you
will get killed.  Use the stations inside to power up, but watch your back.

BLASTED BATTLEFIELD - Map by Red Shifter.
Play outdoors for a change of pace.  This map will require accuracy, energy conservation,
and amazing dueling skills.  If you truly wish to prove your mastery of the blaster, you
will do it on this battlefield.  The hilly terrain is makes it very difficult to duel with
a blaster, and is your major obstacle.

FRANTIC - Map by Red Shifter.  Inspired by a TK fest on the pond.
Holy crap!  There is little room to move, little room to jet, and to top it all off, there
are no hiding places in this map of pure insanity.  A very simple design gives way to the
twitch gameplay that one would look for in a map named "Frantic".  Strafe like crazy, shoot
like crazy, and hope that you survive.
NOTE: Auto-Flare is disabled on this map.

GORGON - Map by Nefilim.  Adaptation by Red Shifter.
A large base which seems specifically designed for Blaster Deathmatch.  There are no real
chokepoints, only some frantic battles around the level.  Keep moving, hunt your enemies
down, but remember - there is no way out of this maze.  Also, you may want to be careful of
sloped walls - your blaster will reflect in strange ways...

SCARABRAE - Map by Nefilim/Dynamix.  Adaptation by Red Shifter.  Thoughts by Gogo0.
A classical showdown of the masters of the blasters.  Undertake in an epic blaster duel that
spans outdoors and indoors!  Move around the massive base, or sit around outdoors.  Players
can use stations to heal themselves, or just duel their ways to pure ownage.

SUN DRIED - Map by Dynamix Staff.  Adaptation by Red Shifter.
Standard Deathmatch fare.  Mostly flat ground and large open spaces make it very difficult
to use the terrain to your advantage.  You need energy conservation, great accuracy, and
decent dueling skills to win on this map.

THE BASEMENT - Map by Red Shifter.
Forcefields haunt you at every turn.  They can appear and disappear as they please.  These
evil forcefields like to spring up on you when you're fighting and throw you off your game.
Don't be foiled!  Beware of ledges in a few rooms, for enemies can hide and snipe at you.

THE GREAT HALL - Map by Red Shifter.  Concept by DSEZ.
A simple little room.  What's the worst that could happen?  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE on this
decievingly calm map.  The lower part of the room is where people duel it out for the right
to own, while the upper part of the room is used by players who like to play it safe and
try to snipe their enemies.  With over 10 people, this map can become a frantic hell within
five seconds.
NOTE: Auto-Flare is disabled on this map.

ULTIMA THULE - Map by Dynamix Staff.  Adaptation by Red Shifter.
A huge base to explore.  Be careful and cautious, or you may run into an ambush!  This map
was built for a lot of players.  Hang out in the complicated outer hallways, or undertake
in a massive free-for-all in the great hall!  Stations will heal the weary warrior, while
forcefields will give you a simple message - there is no escape from this cold maze.

ADVICE TO MAPPERS
-------------------------

- Version Compatibility
        Originally, the gametype was known as BlasterDM.  Because I wanted to confuse the
hell out of people, I changed the name of the gametype to the three capital letters BDM.
But then, I took another lateral into BlasterDM to confuse myself.

// MissionTypes = BlasterDM

Nobody released any Blaster Deathmatch maps, so I only confused myself.



- Flare Throwing
        When a player takes a hit, a flare is spontaneously thrown.  This is just a special
effect I thought up.  However, if your map has a lot of players in a single area, the FPS
can really drop.  Therefore, I included a mechanism to shut down this feature for your map.

Blaster DM maps should have the setting "NoFlare".  0 will activate auto-flare, while 1
will deactivate it.

See TheGreatHall_BDM.mis for an example.  You can't miss it.



- Inventory Stations
        When a player dies, their score is decreased by 1 point, and the killer gains 5/8
points as opposed to 3/4 points for a regular hit.  Therefore, humping the station is not
as cheap a strategy as in normal Deathmatch.  Self-healing makes this strategy even more
worthless.

        You should place stations into massive maps, but leave them out of the smaller
maps. It gets frantic in there, and players will hate falling into a station at the most
critical of times.  However, this can be used as a feature instead of an annoyance... :)



- Foreign Objects
        A warning to mappers who feel like placing some unexpected objects into their maps.
Don't.  There's no reason to do so, and the game's scripts won't approve.

WEAPONS:  Players don't gain points for using weaponry other than blaster, but they will
lose points if killed by these weapons.  Blaster Deathmatch was never meant to be stupid.
Don't make it that way.

PACKS:    The coding in this gametype stops players from picking up packs of any kind.  So
don't place any useless shield packs into your maps for cynics to pick up.

GRENADES: Regular grenades are restricted in the same way as weaponry.  Whiteout grenades
are a pure annoyance, and have no place in Tribes 2 to begin with.  Concussion grenades
can be EXTREMELY annoying, since you can't replace your pack.  Flares are safe grenades,
but do you really need MORE of those flying around?

CAMERAS:  The only deployable that can even be picked up is the Camera.  There's no reason
to throw those into the gametype, so don't do so.

FUTURE PLANS
-------------------------
- What the hell else IS there to do?  Fix glitches that can't ever be fixed?

CREDITS
-------------------------
Thanks goes to multiple people for...

Myself: Owning with the blaster.  I am the true Master of the Blaster.

Gogo0: Formerly owning with the blaster.  How the mighty have fallen.

Kamikaze Samurai: Annoying me with SL to the point that I made Blaster Deathmatch.

DSEZ: I forgot who helped me with Great Hall and just released it anonymously, but it was
    FRIGGIN DSEZ!

a tiny fishie: Helping me with some script issues and hosting this on his site, as well as
    making SLDM which was very helpful as a template for this gametype.

Dr Pimento: Helping me get my gametype playtested in the Tribes2Maps.com Pickups.  Without
    him, I wouldn't realize how bad the Great Hall truly was as a map.

Auza: Taking my title of Blaster Master long enough for me to train in the ways of my old
    weapon and then finally defeat him to regain the title that is rightfully mine.

Golarth The Bold: Haxing spawngraphs and possibly figuring out the solution to my spawning
    problem.

Multiple players: Playtesting the gametype and making me realize I need to increase FPS.

Countless others: Shooting down my idea for Blaster CTF (why not?  it'd be funny!)
