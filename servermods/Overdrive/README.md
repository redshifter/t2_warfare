# Tribes 2: Overdrive mod
UltraRS, except with classic physics and a cool gimmick.

Try picking up an Energy Pack (either in the wild or from a station) and pressing the pack button.

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
- Unzip the [Overdrive.zip](Overdrive.zip) file into the GameData folder of your Tribes 2 install, preserving folder integrity. This should create the GameData\Overdrive folder.
- Run **Tribes2.exe -mod Overdrive -nologin**

# WARNING
This contains an entire classic mod inside of it. Dropping tacomod on top of it will probably cause issue. If I feel like it later, I might fix this.
