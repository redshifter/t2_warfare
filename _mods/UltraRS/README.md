# Tribes 2: UltraRS mod
A crappy Ultra mod where you have a bunch of weapons. There are a few hilarious surprises, but this is based on base mod. I would just skip it in favor of Overdrive (for the lulz) or Hyperdrive (for "serious" play).

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
- Unzip the [UltraRS.zip](UltraRS.zip) file into the GameData folder of your Tribes 2 install, preserving folder integrity. This should create the GameData\UltraRS folder.
- Run **Tribes2.exe -mod UltraRS -nologin**
