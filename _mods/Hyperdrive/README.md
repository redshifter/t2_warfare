# Tribes 2: Hyperdrive mod
UltraRS, except with classic physics and limited weapon ammo.

Your weapon has limited shots but it quickly reloads itself. Therefore you need to be more careful with your shots.

It really shouldn't be called Hyperdrive at all since it removes the <s>hilarious</s> gimmick introduced by the Overdrive mod.

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
- Unzip the [Hyperdrive.zip](Hyperdrive.zip) file into the GameData folder of your Tribes 2 install, preserving folder integrity. This should create the GameData\Hyperdrive folder.
- Run **Tribes2.exe -mod Hyperdrive -nologin**

# WARNING
This contains an entire classic mod inside of it. Dropping tacomod on top of it will probably cause issue. If I feel like it later, I might fix this.
